                <p> <span class="strong">Ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for
                        dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a
                        serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up
                        understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France
                        where
                        he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will
                        dedicate
                        the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children - although
                        few
                        of them remember it.</span> a And so I correct my dedication:</p>
                <h2>TO LEON WERTH WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY</h2>
                <hr>
                <p><strong>I</strong></p>
                <p>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent <u>in a book, called</u> <em>Stories from
                        Nature</em>,
                    about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a <s>constrictor in the act of swallowing an
                        animal.</s>
                    Here is a copy of the drawing.</p>
                <a href="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/hroznys.jpg"
                    title="Boa Constrictor" target="_blank"><img
                        src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/hroznys.jpg"
                        alt="Boa Constrictor"></a>
                <p>In the book it said:<em>"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After
                        that they
                        are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."</em>
                </p>
                <p>I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored
                    pencil I
                    succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:</p>
                <img src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/klobouk.jpg"
                    alt=" 
                    Hat">
                <p>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and I asked them whether the drawing frightened them.
                </p>
                <p>But they answered: <span class="quote">"Frightened? Why should any one be frightened by a
                        hat?"</span></p>
                <q>Why should any one be frightened by a hat?</q>
                </em></p>
                <p>
                <blockquote>drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor
                    <cite>an
                        elephant.
